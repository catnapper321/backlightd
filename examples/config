## Upon startup, all displays are set to this brightness level. Default 4.
# default_level = 4

## Default socket is $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/backlight
# socket_path = /path/to/server/socket

## Logging config

## Log levels are trace, debug, info, warn, error
# log_level = "error"

## Set to false to elide timestamps from log entries
# log_timestamp = true

## The first display is special: When toggling all monitors on/off, the state
## of this monitor is the one all others follow. Currently, this monitor must
## implement the sysfs flavor of onoff_control.

## If gamma is not specified, backlightd assumes a linear brightness response.
## If it's not linear, and you don't know for sure what it is, try 2.2
gamma = 2.2

## Absolute maximum brightness value, typically 100 or specified in 
## /sys/../some_backlight/max_brightness
max = 120000

## The lowest brightness value for this display
min = 750

## Reference brightness range: The range of perceptual brightness that can be 
## represented by every display.
##
## The brightness at the bottom the range is defined by the display that is 
## brighter than the others when all are set to their lowest setting.
## The top of the range is defined by the display that is dimmest when set to
## its highest possible brightness.
##
## The ref_max and ref_min parameters specify, for this monitor, the brightness
## values corresponding to the top and bottom of the reference brightness range.
## If ref_max and ref_min are not specified, they are equal to max and min.
##
## When ref_max, ref_min, and gamma are correctly configured for each display,
## all displays will have approximately equal brightness at every brightness
## level between 0 (all displays at their ref_max values) and 9 (all displays 
## at their ref_min values).
## 
## This example monitor has a max value of 120000 and a ref_max of 90000, which
## means that it can achieve a higher brightness than the other display in this
## config.
ref_max = 90000

## brightness control via ddcutil. Use "ddcutil detect" to find the display
## number to use here. Currently only sysfs and ddcutil may be used here.
brightness_control = "ddcutil:1"

## Gamma 1.0 is a linear response, and backlightd assumes a brightness value
## range # of 0..=100 in this case unless otherwise specified with max and min.
## This is typical of brightness controlled via ddcutil.
gamma = 1.0
